### 反应式 4 原则

Reactive applications are built on four guiding principles.

- A responsive application is the goal.
- A responsive application is both scalable and resilient. Responsiveness is impossible to achieve without both scalability and resilience.
- A message-driven architecture is the foundation of scalable, resilient, and ultimately responsive systems.

（1）反应灵敏
（2）可扩展性
（3）弹性
（4）消息驱动

The main difference between messages and events is that messages are directed while events happen. Messages have a clear destination while events may be observed by zero or more (0-N) observers.
